	<p>Creates a topology from an environment blueprint.</p>
	<p>The "Output File" parameter denotes where the new environment's outputs will be written to. Later build steps
	can inspect this file in order to grab information pertinent to them (such as IP addresses, user names and so forth).</p>
	<p>All input fields support standard Jenkins parameters' expansion. For example, the string <code>${app_name}</code> will be
	expanded, in runtime, to the value of a build parameter called <code>app_name</code>.</p>
	<p>For explanation about the format of the outputs file, refer to the help tooltip for that parameter.</p>
